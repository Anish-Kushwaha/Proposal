## ✨ Features

- **Multi-step romantic proposal flow**  
  The proposal is not a single screen. The user is guided through multiple steps, making the experience playful and engaging.

- **Cute animated GIFs (Tenor embeds)**  
  Carefully chosen GIFs are embedded using Tenor to visually express emotions at each stage of the proposal.

- **Romantic background music (auto-play & loop)**  
  Soft romantic music plays in the background to enhance the emotional experience.

- **Falling hearts animation on acceptance**  
  When the user finally clicks “Yes”, animated hearts fall across the screen to celebrate the moment.

- **“No” button that moves away**  
  A fun JavaScript interaction where the “No” button avoids the cursor, making rejection almost impossible.

- **Mobile-first responsive design**  
  Designed primarily for mobile devices while remaining fully functional on desktops and tablets.

- **Single-file implementation**  
  Entire project is contained in a single `index.html` file for simplicity and easy deployment.

- **No frameworks, no dependencies**  
  Built without React, Bootstrap, jQuery, or any external UI libraries.
